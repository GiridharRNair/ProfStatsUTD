## Frontend Overview

Built with Vite with React, incorporating Chakra UI for the interface. It optimizes backend performance through debouncing, ensures data accuracy with client-side validation, and employs the [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/) plugin for Chrome extension hot module reloading (HMR) during development.

### Updating Version

Simply update the version in the `package.json` file, and when you start the server in development or production, it will automatically reflect the updated version in the manifest file. You might need to reload the extension in Chrome or remove and re-add the extension to see the updated version.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions automate the staging of the extension on the Chrome Web Store using [Chrome-Webstore-Upload-Action](https://github.com/fregante/chrome-webstore-upload). However, the user still needs to manually submit it for review, although the entire tedious uploading process is automated.

## Backend Overview

Developed in Golang using Gin Gonic, it utilizes an SQLite database generated by a Python script in `db_setup` based on grades data in `raw_data`. The system fetches ratings from the Rate My Professor GraphQL API and queries the aggregated grade distribution from the generated SQLite database for all courses or a specific course.

### Endpoints

### 2. Get Professor Suggestions

#### Endpoint: `/professor_suggestions`

- **Method:** GET

#### Endpoint: `/professor_courses`

- **Method:** GET

### CORS Configuration

The API allows requests from the following origins:

### Deployment

Dockerized and deployed on Azure Web App Service using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
