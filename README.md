The front end ensures a streamlined interface with features like backend performance optimization, client-side validation for data accuracy, and [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/) for Chrome extension hot module reloading during development.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions automates staging on the Chrome Web Store upon new Github version releases, utilizing the [Chrome-Webstore-Upload-Action](https://github.com/fregante/chrome-webstore-upload). While manual review submission is required, the uploading process is fully automated.

Utilizing the Golang Gin framework, the backend fetches ratings from the Rate My Professor GraphQL API and queries aggregated grade distribution from an SQLite database.

### Database

The database is dynamically generated by a Python script in `db_setup` before the backend server is started, using only Python's standard library and the grade distributions in `raw_data`.

> [!NOTE]  
> The grade distributions in `raw_data` are from the [UTD Grades](https://github.com/acmutd/utd-grades/tree/master/raw_data) repository

### CORS Configuration

The API allows requests only from the following origin:

-   `chrome-extension://doilmgfedjlpepeaolcfpdmkehecdaff`

### Deployment

Dockerized and deployed on the Azure Web App Service after running the Python scripts that generate and test the SQLite database, using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
