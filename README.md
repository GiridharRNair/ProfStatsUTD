## Deployment

Backend deployment is automated using Docker and Azure Web App, managed through a concise CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. Commits trigger seamless updates, handling Docker image creation, Azure Container Registry push, and deployment to Azure Web App with ease. No manual steps required.

The frontend deployment is a manual process, I need to zip the `dist` folder and upload it to the Chrome Web Store to publish a new version. The review process takes about 2-3 days, depending on the permissions requested in the manifest.
