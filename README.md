## Frontend Overview

Built with Vite, React, and Chakra UI for a streamlined interface. Optimizes backend performance through debouncing, ensures data accuracy with client-side validation, and utilizes [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/) for Chrome extension hot module reloading (HMR) during development.

### Updating Version

Simply update the version in `package.json`. Starting the server in development or production will automatically reflect the updated version in the manifest file. Reload or remove and re-add the extension to see the changes.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions automate staging on the Chrome Web Store using [Chrome-Webstore-Upload-Action](https://github.com/fregante/chrome-webstore-upload). While manual submission for review is required, the tedious uploading process is fully automated.

## Backend Overview

Built with Golang and Gin Gonic, the backend utilizes an SQLite database generated by a Python script in `db_setup`, sourcing data from `raw_data`. The system fetches ratings from the Rate My Professor GraphQL API and queries the aggregated grade distribution from the SQLite database for all courses or a specific course.

### Endpoints

   - **Endpoint:** `/professor_info`
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Query Parameters:**
     - `teacher` (required): Name of the professor.
     - `course` (optional): Course subject and number (e.g., CS 1337).
   - **Response:**
     - Detailed information about the specified professor, including ratings, department, and grade distribution for all courses or a specific course.

2. **Get Course Information**

   - **Endpoint:** `/course_info`
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Query Parameters:**
     - `course` (required): Course subject and number (e.g., CS 1337).
   - **Response:**
     - Returns the name and grade distribution of the specified course.

3. **Search Query Suggestions**

   - **Endpoint:** `/suggestions`
   - **Method:** GET
   - **Query Parameters:**
     - `teacher` (optional): Name of the professor.
     - `course` (optional): Course subject and number (e.g., CS 1337).
   - **Response:**
     - Returns a list of distinct professor and course names similar to the specified query.

### CORS Configuration

The API allows requests from the following origins:

- `http://localhost:5173`
- `chrome-extension://doilmgfedjlpepeaolcfpdmkehecdaff`

### Deployment

Dockerized and deployed on Azure Web App Service using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
