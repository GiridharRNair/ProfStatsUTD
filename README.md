## Frontend Overview

Built with Vite with React, incorporating Chakra UI for the interface. It optimizes backend performance through debouncing, ensures data accuracy with client-side validation, and employs the [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/) plugin for Chrome extension hot module reloading (HMR) during development.

### Updating Version

Simply update the version in the `package.json` file, and when you start the server in development or production, it will automatically reflect the updated version in the manifest file. You might need to reload or remove and re-add the extension to see the updated version.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions automate the staging of the extension on the Chrome Web Store using [Chrome-Webstore-Upload-Action](https://github.com/fregante/chrome-webstore-upload). However, the user still needs to manually submit it for review, although the entire tedious uploading process is automated.

## Backend Overview

Developed in Golang using Gin Gonic, it utilizes an SQLite database generated by a Python script in `db_setup` based on grades data in `raw_data`. The system fetches ratings from the Rate My Professor GraphQL API and queries the aggregated grade distribution from the generated SQLite database for all courses or a specific course.

### Endpoints

- **Method:** GET
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `course` (required): Course subject and number (e.g. CS 1337).

### 3. Search Query Suggestions

#### Endpoint: `/suggestions`

- **Method:** GET
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `teacher` (optional): Name of the professor.
  - `course` (optional): Course subject and number (e.g. CS 1337).

#### Response

Returns a list of distinct professor and course names that are most similar to the specified query.

### CORS Configuration

The API allows requests from the following origins:

- `http://localhost:5173`
- `chrome-extension://doilmgfedjlpepeaolcfpdmkehecdaff`

### Deployment

Dockerized and deployed on Azure Web App Service using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
