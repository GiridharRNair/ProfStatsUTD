## Frontend Overview

Built with Vite + React, incorporating Chakra UI for the interface. It optimizes backend performance through debouncing, ensures data accuracy with client-side validation, and employs the [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/) plugin for Chrome extension HMR during development.

### Updating Version

Simply update the version in the `package.json` file. Starting the server in development or production will automatically reflect the updated version in the manifest file.

### Deployment

GitHub Actions automate the extension staging on the Chrome Web Store via [Chrome-Webstore-Upload-Action](https://github.com/fregante/chrome-webstore-upload), but a manual step persists for developers to submit it for review, while the overall tedious uploading process is automated.

## Backend Overview

Developed in Golang using Gin Gonic, it uses an SQLite database generated by a Python script in `db_setup` based on grades data in `raw_data`. The system queries the Rate My Professor GraphQL API for ratings and fetches aggregated grade distributions from the SQLite database.
